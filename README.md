<h1>Firefox Update Script</h1>

This script was developed to update firefox version on Ubuntu 8.04
(Hardy Heron) by downloading the newest .tar.bz2 file from the official mozilla web site and replacing the current installation.<br>
I had the idea of creating this script after several discussions with ubuntu users. They were complaining about the amount of time that takes Canonical to include new version of firefox in Ubuntu repositories. 
After more than 4 years, people still tell me that the script works. It has been tested in Ubuntu (8.04 and above), debian and derivatives (like mint).<br> 
I Hope this scripts becomes useful for you too!
