<h1>Linux Scripts</h1>

This repository will contain different scripts that I am creating to perform specific tasks in Linux. Despite the fact the fact that in most cases I use Debian and derivatives (such as Ubuntu and Mint), I always try to write the scripts as generic as possible so they should work as expected in all distributions.

<h4>Firefox Update Script</h4>

This script was developed to update firefox version on Ubuntu 8.04
(Hardy Heron) by downloading the newest .tar.bz2 file from the official mozilla web site and replacing the current installation.<br>
I had the idea of creating this script after several discussions with ubuntu users. They were complaining about the amount of time that takes Canonical to include new version of firefox in Ubuntu repositories. 
After more than 4 years, people still tell me that the script works. It has been tested in Ubuntu (8.04 and above), debian and derivatives (like mint).<br> 
I Hope this scripts becomes useful for you too!
